# LSCVM: Quintessential Harlequin
Programming

## Challenge 

	DESCRIPTION
	During our recon on the notorious fools of LightSpeedCorp, we have discovered this service which runs on a really simple, tiny, trivial, virtual machine that they have created. We are not sure of its purpose, but it certainly looks fun to play with.

	lscvm-qh.cddc19q.ctf.sg 9002

	IMPORTANT: We will use this VM again in the Final.

	MD5("lscvm-qh"): 4D39DB97A23D6FC049C1D050AC44A727

	ATTACHED FILES
	lscvm-qh
