## Challenge 

	DESCRIPTION
	The blue team in LightSpeedCorp ends their work week at 8pm on Saturdays. At 7:59pm, a strange file was sent to one of their staff. It looks a lot like a malware variant which has infiltrated their company recently, using batch scripts to attack the organization.

	This time, the attacker seems to have made some errors in their code. Can you fix it?
	The flag will be printed out if you fix the code and run it. This requires less than 10 characters in the script to be modified.

	MD5("notepadconfig.cmd"): BC954CD664B32128370469BADEE17BCF

	ATTACHED FILES
	notepadconfig.cmd
